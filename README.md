# Intensity Mapping for Mask Projection based Photopolymerization

Currently, the industrial de-facto assumption for photopolymerizationsystems is that the ultraviolet light of the mask-projection is uniformly distributed. This paper presents a method for measuring this intensity field or distribution of this mask-projection. By measuring the light distribution, it is shown that the emitted light is not uniformly distributed and thus the current assumption is invalid. Furthermore, a methodology for obtaining a mask to compensate for the irregularities of the projected light, that will ensure an even and controlled exposure of the photopolymer, is presented. Accordingly, it is demonstrated that this mask compensates for such irregularities, making the light projection significantly more uniformly distributed.
